# Neural-Network-Galaxy-Classification

The implementation and evaluation of a neural network classifier for galaxy classification, specifically differentiating between STARFORMING and STARBURST galaxies. The project involved comprehensive data preprocessing, hyperparameter optimisation through grid search, and the development of a novel sign-based adaptive learning rate algorithm. The adaptive learning rate method demonstrated competitive performance compared to static learning rates, with insights gained into the optimisation dynamics of neural network training.
